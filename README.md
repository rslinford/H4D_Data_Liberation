DATA LIBERATION PROJECT

Information that should be freely accessible - that supposedly is publically accessible, but which is stored so cumbersomely on the New Hampshire Secretary of State website that is might as well be under lock and key.

This is important information.  There’s a reason it’s supposed to be publically accessible.  The data in question is who is spending the all the dark money in our supposedly fair elections. Specifically New Hampshire’s elections, because you’ve got to start somewhere and NH is a very important battleground state, but I see this sort of data liberation project eventually growing nationally.  

For this project, I believe, there’s two main questions that people ought to know the answer to.  First, there are nearly 1000 lobbyist-client arrangements in NH, and I really think citizens ought to know who pays for these lobbyists, and how much are they paying to make sure that their own agenda is front and center in the state legislature.

The second question is similar, but it’s about a perhaps even murkier source of campaign financing - who pays how much in the supposedly “independent” election expenditures.  It’s public information, and you can bet the legislators know who spent good money on their behalf.  I think the people ought to know that too.
